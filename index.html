      <h1>HIT THE TRAIL</h1>
      <p>Whether you're going hard or just enjoying the scenery, having the right
         gear makes the ride. A pair of padded shorts and some polarized shades make
         all the difference when it comes to your comfort. We also suggest matching
         your helmet to your bike since there's nothing more important than looking
         good on the trail.
